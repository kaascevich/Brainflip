# To Do

- [ ] Enable the array popover to be detatched
- [ ] Clean up `ProgramState` (*god*, that thing's a mess)
- [ ] Allow signed cells in addition to unsigned
- [ ] Add option to disable cell overflow/underflow
- [ ] Further simplify `AppSettings` in one of two ways:
  - Adding support for `@dynamicMemberLookup`
  - Creating a macro (preferred)

## Completed
- [x] Allow 1-bit, 2-bit, and 4-bit cell sizes
- [x] Add copy and paste buttons
- [x] Get unit/UI tests up and running

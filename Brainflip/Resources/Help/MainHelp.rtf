\f0\fs24 \cf0 Brainflip is a very simple programming language, only consisting of nine instructions.
\fs10 \
\

\fs24 All Brainflip programs manipulate a finite 
\f1\i \kerning1\expnd-2\expndtw-7
array
\f0\i0 \kerning1\expnd0\expndtw0  of 
\f1\i \kerning1\expnd-2\expndtw-7
cell\kerning1\expnd0\expndtw0 s
\f0\i0 , and each cell holds a positive integer. Cells are 
\f1\i \kerning1\expnd-2\expndtw-7
indexed
\f0\i0 \kerning1\expnd0\expndtw0  starting from cell 0; with default settings, this means that the last cell has an index of 29,999.
\fs10 \
\

\fs24 The array's size can be set between 30,000 and 60,000 cells. This setting, as well as many others, can be accessed by going to Brainflip > Settings... in the menu bar, or by pressing \uc0\u8984 , (command + comma).
\fs10 \
\

\fs24 Cells can be set to 
\f1\i \kerning1\expnd-2\expndtw-7
8-bit
\f0\i0 \kerning1\expnd0\expndtw0 , 
\f1\i \kerning1\expnd-2\expndtw-7
16-bit
\f0\i0 \kerning1\expnd0\expndtw0 , or 
\f1\i \kerning1\expnd-2\expndtw-7
32-bit
\f0\i0 \kerning1\expnd0\expndtw0 . With 8-bit cells, the maximum number a cell can hold is 255 (2
\fs16 \up8 8
\fs24 \up0  - 1). Similarly, 16-bit cells can hold numbers up to 65,536 (2
\fs16 \up8 16
\fs24 \up0  - 1), and 32-bit cells can hold numbers up to 4,294,967,295 (2
\fs16 \up8 32
\fs24 \up0  - 1).
\fs10 \
\

\fs24 A 
\f1\i \kerning1\expnd-2\expndtw-7
pointer
\f0\i0 \kerning1\expnd0\expndtw0  is used to keep track of the cell that is currently being manipulated. Its initial location can be set between cell 0 and cell 100.
\fs10 \
\

\fs24 Brainflip's instructions are as follows:
\f2 \

\f3\b <
\f4  
\f0\b0 : Moves the pointer to the previous cell, throwing an error if going below the bounds of the array.
\f2 \

\f3\b >
\f4  
\f0\b0 : Moves the pointer to the next cell, throwing an error if going above the bounds of the array.
\f2 \

\f3\b +
\f4  
\f0\b0 : Increments the current cell by 1. If the cell was at its maximum, underflows to 0.
\f2 \

\f3\b -
\f4  
\f0\b0 : Decrements the current cell by 1. If the cell was at 0, overflows to its maximum.
\f2 \

\f3\b [
\f4  
\f0\b0 : Checks if the current cell contains 0; if so, skips to the matching ].
\f2 \

\f3\b ]
\f4  
\f0\b0 : Checks if the current cell contains 0; if it does not, returns to the matching [.
\f2 \

\f3\b .
\f4  
\f0\b0 : If the current cell is less than 256, outputs the ASCII equivalent of the current cell.
\f2 \

\f3\b ,
\f4  
\f0\b0 : Gets the next character of user input and stores the numerical ASCII equivalent to the current cell. The action performed on end-of-input is customizable.
\f2 \

\f3\b #
\f4  
\f0\b0 : If enabled in the settings, stops the program immediately.
\fs10 \
\

\fs24 All characters other than the ones listed above are treated as comments and ignored.
\fs10 \
\

\fs24 In order for a Brainflip program to run, all brackets must 
\f1\i \kerning1\expnd-2\expndtw-7
match
\f0\i0 \kerning1\expnd0\expndtw0 . For any "
\f5 [
\f0 ", its matching "
\f5 ]
\f0 " is:\
 - Somewhere after its "
\f5 [
\f0 " in the source file.\
 - Separated from its "
\f5 [
\f0 " by as many "
\f5 [
\f0 "s  as "
\f5 ]
\f0 "s.\
 - The first "
\f5 ]
\f0 " that meets these two conditions.
\fs10 \
\

\fs24 Brainflip programs terminate after executing the last instruction in the program (or upon encountering a stop instruction, if enabled).}

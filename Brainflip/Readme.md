# Brainflip
a human-usable brainf\*\*k interpreter

## To-Do

- [x] Implement an App Shortcut
- [ ] Enable the array popover to be detatched
- [ ] Clean up `ProgramState` (*god*, that thing's a mess)

## Overview

We've all heard of brainf\*\*k -- you know, that "*programming language*" where the standard "Hello, World!" program looks like this:

```brainfuck
>++++++++[<+++++++++>-]<.>++++[<+++++++>-]<+.+++++++..+++.>>++++++[<+++++++>-]<+
+.------------.>++++++[<+++++++++>-]<+.<.+++.------.--------.>>>++++[<++++++++>-
]<+.
```

Not very inticing, is it?

Brainflip attempts (*attempts*) to remedy that. You're provided with a relatively full-fledged editor (albeit one that still says "Type your program here...") to do your evildoings with. You can run programs (*wow, what features!*), trim those programs to make them *really* unreadable, step through programs to identify that one stupid instruction that's breaking literally everything, 

### Contextual Junk

This is basically my pet project. I've been working on it since 10:09â€¯AM on February 23, 2023, if APFS folder creation dates are to be trusted.

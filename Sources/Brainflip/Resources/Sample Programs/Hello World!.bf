[This program outputs "Hello World!" and a newline. Its length is 106 active instructions. (It is not the shortest.)]

[These loops are "initial comment loops", a simple way of adding comments to a Brainflip program such that you don't have to worry about any instructions. Any ".", ",", "+", "-", "<" and ">" characters are simply ignored, the "[" and "]" characters just have to be balanced. This loop and the instructions it contains are ignored because the current cell defaults to a value of 0; the 0 value causes this loop to be skipped.]
 
++++++++       Set cell 0 to 8
[
 >++++         Add 4 to cell 1; this always sets it to 4
 [             as the cell will be cleared by the loop
  >++          Add 2 to cell 2
  >+++         Add 3 to cell 3
  >+++         Add 3 to cell 4
  >+           Add 1 to cell 5
  <<<<-        Decrement the loop counter in cell 1
 ]             Loop until cell 1 is zero; 4 iterations
 >+            Add 1 to cell 2
 >+            Add 1 to cell 3
 >-            Subtract 1 from cell 4
 >>+           Add 1 to cell 6
 [<]           Move back to the first zero cell found; this will
               be cell 1 which was cleared by the previous loop
 <-            Decrement the loop counter in cell 0
]              Loop until cell 0 is zero; 8 iterations

The result of this is:
Cell no :   0   1   2   3   4   5   6
Contents:   0   0  72 104  88  32   8
Pointer :   ^

>>.            Cell 2 has value 72 which is 'H'
>---.          Subtract 3 from cell 3 to get 101 which is 'e'
+++++++..+++.  Likewise for 'llo' from cell 3
>>.            Cell 5 is 32 for the space
<-.            Subtract 1 from cell 4 for 87 to get a 'W'
<.             Cell 3 was set to 'o' from the end of 'Hello'
+++.------.    Cell 3 for 'rl'
--------.      Cell 3 for 'd' too
>>+.           Add 1 to cell 5 to get an exclamation point
>++.           And finally a newline from cell 6

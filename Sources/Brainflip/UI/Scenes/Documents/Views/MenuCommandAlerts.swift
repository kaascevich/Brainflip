                When you export your Brainflip program as a C source file, Brainflip will translate your program into C source code, ignoring comments. When compiled with an external tool, this code will behave just as your Brainflip program did, with the following exceptions:
                
                • Input will only be requested upon reaching an input instruction. If the program appears to be stuck, it might be waiting for user input; type one character and press return. (To signal end-of-input, press return without typing anything else.)
                • Unless otherwise stated below, your current settings will be applied to the generated C code. Different C code will be created for different settings.
                • If the end-of-input setting is set to "Set the current cell to <maximum value>", the generated program will behave as if it is set to "Set the current cell to zero"; be aware that this might cause incompatibility with some programs.
                • If the cell size is set to 1-bit, 2-bit, or 4-bit, the generated program will behave as if it is set to 8-bit. This might also cause incompatibility.

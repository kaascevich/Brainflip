    ///   - metrics: An array of metrics to measure, like CPU, memory, or elapsed time.

    ///     complete. The default timeout allows the test to run until it reaches its
    ///     execution time allowance.
    ///   - file: The file where the failure occurs. The default is the filename
    ///     of the test case where you call this function.
    ///   - line: The line number where the failure occurs. The default is the
    ///     line number where you call this function.
